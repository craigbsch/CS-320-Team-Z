# UMass Nutritional Tracker 

UMass Nutritional Tracker is a Web app in construction. The finalized version will allow users to set basic nutrition goals. In addition a user may add meals from UMass dining halls.

## Usage

Currently this project is not usable as it is under development. Once finished a user should be able to login with UMass credentials, setup nutritional goals, and add meals to update the goals as well as look at progress. This is the most basic usable form. See roadmap for additional features we are considering.

## Roadmap 

Our first major goal is to get this into basic running shape, namely having user accounts tied to the UMass one login, adding meals, web scraping for the menu and basic nutritional fact tracking.

Other features we have discussed adding if we have the time:

Menu Display,

Additional nutritional goal tracking,

Meal suggestions,

User reviews on meals,
