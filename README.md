# UMass Nutritional Tracker 

UMass Nutritional Tracker is a Webapp in construction. An improved version of the UMass Dining app, this seeks to be the premier app for students accessing dining information. It is constructed by web-scraping the dining site, and then filtering the data into a usable form for our users.

## Usage

This project is not yet usable, as it is under development. Once finished a user should be able to login and create an account, setup nutritional goals, and add meals to update the goals as well as look at progress in a graph form (viewing their weight and calorie consumption over time, as well as other macronutrients). This is the most basic usable form. See roadmap for additional features we are considering.

## Roadmap 

Our first major goal is to get this into basic running shape, namely having user accounts, web scraping for the menu and basic nutritional fact tracking.
This includes implementing functionalities such as:

- Account creation
- Login/Logout
- User Profile management: Allow users to manage account information such as name, password, meal plan preferences, and dietary restrictions
- Menu Display: A display of menus from dining halls, with options to filter by meal type, allergens, and preferences
- Meal tracking: Allow users to select meals they have consumed from various menus and log them into their daily intake
- Goal tracking: Allow users to track goals for basic calorie consumption and hydration, based on logged meals

Once we have implemented these features, we will focus more on enhancing user experience by adding features such as:

- Meal suggestions: Personalized meal suggestions based on users' nutritional goals, preferences, and dining hall offerings
- Additional nutritional goal tracking: Allow users to track more than just basic calorie consumption and hydration, such as tracking macros and specific nutrient intake
- Enhanced Data Visualization: Improve visualization of user progress over time, including weight and calorie consumption trends, through interactive graphs and charts
- User reviews on meals: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for meals they have consumed, as well as providing direct feedback to other users and UMass Dining
- In-app Notifications and Reminders: Reminders for users to log their meals and track progress towards their goals
- Accessibility Features: Provide accessibility to users with disabilities by implementing voice commands, screen reader compatibility, and adjustable font sizes and contrast settings
