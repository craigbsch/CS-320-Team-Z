# UMass Nutritional Tracker 

UMass Nutritional Tracker is a Webapp in construction. An improved version of the UMass Dining app, this seeks to be the premier app for students accessing dining information. It is constructed by web-scraping the dining site, and then filtering the data into a usable form for our users.

## Usage

This project is not yet usable, as it is under development. Once finished a user should be able to login and create an account, setup nutritional goals, and add meals to update the goals as well as look at progress in a graph form (viewing their weight and calorie consumption over time, as well as other macronutrients). This is the most basic usable form. See roadmap for additional features we are considering.

## Roadmap 

Our first major goal is to get this into basic running shape, namely having user accounts, web scraping for the menu and basic nutritional fact tracking.

Other features we have discussed adding if we have the time:

Menu Display,

Additional nutritional goal tracking,

Meal suggestions,

User reviews on meals,
